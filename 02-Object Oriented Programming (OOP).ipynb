    "\n",
    "is achieved by separating the use of a method from its implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The client can use a method without knowing how it is implemented. The details of the implementation are encapsulated in the\n",
    "method and hidden from the client who invokes the method.\n",

    "This is also known as information\n",
    "hiding or encapsulation.\n",

    "If you decide to change the implementation, the client program will\n",

    "### Data Field Encapsulation\n",
    "Making data fields private protects data and makes the class easy to maintain.\n",
